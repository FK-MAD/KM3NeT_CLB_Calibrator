# KM3NeT CLB Calibrator
## About the KM3NeT CLB Calibrator
The KM3NeT CLB Calibrator is a mechanism that automatically calibrates the magnetic compass of the central logic boards (CLBs) used in the digital optical modules (DOMs) of the ["KM3NeT"] (https://www.km3net.org/) neutrino telescope. I designed and implemented the system during my internship at ["N.C.S.R. “DEMOKRITOS” - Institute of Nuclear & Particle Physics"] (http://www.inp.demokritos.gr/) between July and September 2020.

## Motivation
Every DOM of the KM3NeT telescope is submerged near the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea and continually reports its orientation based on data from the magnetic compass located on its CLB. For the magnetic compass to work properly, a calibration routine must be carried out for every CLB before its DOM integration. Conventionally, this is done manually using a gyroscope-like tool 


This is  accurately in order to reconstruct the trajectory of a possible neutrino magnetic compass of
